## Tools
- <https://github.com/steven2358/awesome-generative-ai>
- **Hugging Face**
  - *Build, train and deploy state of the art models powered by the reference open source in machine learning*
  - *provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio*
  - *models can also perform tasks on several modalities combined, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.*
  - *provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and then share them with the community on our model hub.*
  - Models, Datasets, Docs, ...

- **LangChain**
  - *... using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.*
