  - aus Hands-On High Performance with Spring 5:
    - *MoSKito	is	a	group	of	three	tools:*
      - *MoSKito-Essential:	This	standalone	project	is	the	core	of	MoSKito.	It makes	it	possible	to	monitor	the	application.*
      - *MoSKito-Central:	This	works	as	a	centralized	storage	server.	It	stores	all of	the	performance-related	information.*
      - *MoSKito-Control:	This	tool	works	for	multi-node	web	applications.	It provides	support	for	monitoring	multi-node	web	applications.*
    - *In	order	to	set	up	MoSKito,	we	need	to	install	a	JAR	file	in	the	application's	WEBINF/lib	directory,	which	is	a	common	folder	for	keeping	API	libraries.	It	can	also be	set	up	by	adding	a	new	section	in	the	web.xml	file.
    The	tool	is	capable	of	collecting	all	of	the	application	performance	metrics, including	memory,	threads,	storage,	caches,	registrations,	payments, conversions,	SQL,	services,	load	distribution,	and	many	more.	It	does	not	require users	to	make	any	code	changes	in	the	application.	It	supports	all	major application	servers,	including	Tomcat,	Jetty,	JBoss,	and	Weblogic.	It	stores	the data	locally.*
    - *MoSKito	also	has	a	notification	feature	to	broadcast	an	alert	when	a	threshold	is met.	It	also	records	a	user's	actions,	which	might	be	of	interest	for	monitoring purposes.	MoSKito	offers	a	mobile	application	for	monitoring	the	application	on the	go.	It	also	has	web-based	dashboards.*

      - *Application	performance	management:	In	application	performance management,	New	Relic	features	high-level	metrics	with	the	ability	to	drill down	to	the	code	level	to	see	how	the	application	is	performing.	On	the dashboard,	New	Relic	displays	a	response	time	graph.	New	Relic	uses	the Apdex	index	score	method	to	distill	metrics	into	performance	indicators. New	Relic	requires	the	user	to	manually	set	the	threshold	values.*
      - *Server	monitoring:	New	Relic	focuses	on	the	hardware	the	application servers	are	running	on.	The	measurements	include	CPU	usage,	memory utilization,	disk	I/O,	and	network	I/O.	New	Relic	provides	brief	details	on the	heap	memory	and	garbage	collection	attributes.*
      - *Database	monitoring:	In	New	Relic,	the	dashboard	for	the	database	is	a part	of	the	application	performance	management	dashboard.	It	is	possible	to view	database	monitoring	metrics	through	plugins.*
      - *Insights	and	analytics:	New	Relic	has	a	built-in,	opt-in	database,	which stores	statistics	and	enables	querying	the	database.*

  - *Automatically captures & analyzes GC Logs, thread dumps, heap dumps & several more artifacts to identify root cause.*
  - *compliments Monitoring Tools*
- **Arthas**
  - *allows developers to troubleshoot production issues for Java applications without modifying code or restarting servers*
  - *Often times, the production system network is inaccessible from the local development environment. If issues are encountered in production systems, it is impossible to use IDEs to debug the application remotely. More importantly, debugging in production environment is unacceptable, as it will suspend all the threads, resulting in the suspension of business services.*
