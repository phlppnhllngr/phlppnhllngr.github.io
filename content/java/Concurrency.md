# Concurrency

## JDK

### java.lang.Thread
- *A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.*
- Methoden
  - `long	getId()`
  - `String	getName()`
  - `int getPriority()`
  - `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler getUncaughtExceptionHandler()`
  - `boolean isDaemon()`
  - `void	join()` (+2 Overloads)
  - `void	run()`
  - `void	start()`
    - *Causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread.*
  - `static void yield()`
    - *A hint to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor.*
  - ...
- <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html>

### java.util
- **Timer**
  - *A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread.*
  - *Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for repeated execution at regular intervals.*
  - *Java 5.0 introduced the java.util.concurrent package and one of the concurrency utilities therein is the `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` which is a thread pool for repeatedly executing tasks at a given rate or delay. It is effectively a more versatile replacement for the `Timer`/`TimerTask` combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various time units, and doesn't require subclassing `TimerTask` (just implement `Runnable`). Configuring `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` with one thread makes it equivalent to `Timer`.*

### java.util.concurrent
- **Executor**
  - Interface
  - *An object that executes submitted Runnable tasks*
  - einzige Methode: `void execute(Runnable command)`
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html> 
- **ExecutorService**
  - Interface, extends Executor
  - *provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a `Future` for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks*
  - *can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks*
  - *extends base method `Executor.execute(Runnable)` by creating and returning a `Future` that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion*
  - Methoden
    - `Future<?> submit(Runnable task)`
    - `void shutdown()`
      - *Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.*
    - `List<Runnable>	shutdownNow()`
      - *Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution.*   
    - `boolean awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException`
      - *Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever happens first.* 
    - ...
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html>
- **ScheduledExecutorService**
  - Interface, extends ExecutorService
  - *can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically*
  - Methoden
    - `<V> ScheduledFuture<V>	schedule(Callable<V> callable, long delay, TimeUnit unit)`
      - *Creates and executes a ScheduledFuture that becomes enabled after the given delay.* 
    - `ScheduledFuture<?>	schedule(Runnable command, long delay, TimeUnit unit)`
      - *Creates and executes a one-shot action that becomes enabled after the given delay.* 
    - `ScheduledFuture<?>	scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)`
      - *Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period; that is executions will commence after `initialDelay` then `initialDelay+period`, then `initialDelay + 2 * period`, and so on.*
      - *<mark>If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed</mark>. Otherwise, the task will only terminate via cancellation or termination of the executor.*
      - *<mark>If any execution of this task takes longer than its period, then subsequent executions may start late, but will not concurrently execute.</mark>* 
    - `ScheduledFuture<?>	scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit)`
      - *Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given delay between the termination of one execution and the commencement of the next.*
      - *<mark>If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed</mark>. Otherwise, the task will only terminate via cancellation or termination of the executor.*

- **AbstractExecutorService**
  - *Provides default implementations of `ExecutorService` execution methods* 
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/AbstractExecutorService.html>
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**
  - extends AbstractExecutorService 
  - *executes each submitted task using one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured using `Executors` factory methods.*
  - *To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks*
  - *However, <mark>programmers are urged to use the more convenient `Executors` factory methods</mark> (...), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually configuring and tuning this class:*
  - Es folgen Hinweise zu den Themen: *Core and maximum pool sizes, On-demand construction, Creating new threads, Keep-alive times, Queuing, Rejected tasks, Hook methods, Queue maintenance, Finalization*
  - Methoden
    - `void	setCorePoolSize(int corePoolSize)`
    - `void	setMaximumPoolSize(int maximumPoolSize)`
    - ... 
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html> 
- **ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor**
  - extends ThreadPoolExecutor implements ScheduledExecutorService 
  - *A ThreadPoolExecutor that can additionally schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.*
  - Methoden
    - `void setContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean value)`
      - *Sets the policy on whether to continue executing existing periodic tasks even when this executor has been shutdown.* 
    - `void setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean value)`
      - *Sets the policy on whether to execute existing delayed tasks even when this executor has been shutdown.*
    - ... 
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html>
- **Executors**
  - *Factory and utility methods for `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, `ThreadFactory`, and `Callable` classes defined in this package*
  - Methoden
    - `static ExecutorService newCachedThreadPool()`
      - *Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available.*
      - *These pools will typically improve the performance of programs that execute many short-lived asynchronous tasks.*
      - *Calls to execute will reuse previously constructed threads if available. If no existing thread is available, a new thread will be created and added to the pool.*
      - *Threads that have not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will not consume any resources.*
      - *Note that pools with similar properties but different details (for example, timeout parameters) may be created using ThreadPoolExecutor constructors.*
    - `static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)`
      - *Creates a thread pool that reuses a fixed number of threads operating off a shared unbounded queue.*
      - *At any point, at most nThreads threads will be active processing tasks.*
      - *If additional tasks are submitted when all threads are active, they will wait in the queue until a thread is available.*
      - *If any thread terminates due to a failure during execution prior to shutdown, a new one will take its place if needed to execute subsequent tasks.*
      - *The threads in the pool will exist until it is explicitly shutdown.* 
    - `static ScheduledExecutorService newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize)`
    - `static ExecutorService newSingleThreadExecutor()`
    - `static ScheduledExecutorService newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()`
    - `static ExecutorService newWorkStealingPool()`
    - ... 
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html> 
- **ForkJoinPool**
  - extends AbstractExecutorService
  - *An `ExecutorService` for running `ForkJoinTasks`* 
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html>
