## Andere
- **swagger**
  - *OpenAPI = Specification, Swagger = Tools for implementing the specification* 
  - <https://swagger.io/>
  - <https://swagger.io/swagger-editor/>
- **OpenAPI.Tools**

  - node_module
  - *A proxy that validates responses and requests against an OpenAPI document*
- **har2openapi**
  - *automatically creates API documentation via a OpenApi Spec (OAS) file by using network requests captured in one or more HAR files* 
  - <https://github.com/dcarr178/har2openapi> 
- **Akita**
  - *watches API traffic to automatically generate OpenAPI specs in just minutes, completely black box, without requiring any code or config changes.*
  - *Akita is able to tell you:*
    - *Endpoints added that expose new functionality*
    - *Parameters removed that may break existing clients*
    - *Simple type changes (ex string to int) that can pollute data pipelines*
    - *Complex type changes (ex phone number to datetime) that can break dependencies*
  - <https://docs.akita.software/docs/>
- **mitmproxy2swagger**
  - *automatically converting mitmproxy captures to OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. This means that you can automatically reverse-engineer REST APIs by just running the apps and capturing the traffic.*

  - *is an HTTP proxy / HTTP monitor / Reverse Proxy that enables a developer to view all of the HTTP and SSL / HTTPS traffic between their machine and the Internet. This includes requests, responses and the HTTP headers (which contain the cookies and caching information).* 
  - <https://www.charlesproxy.com/>
- **specmatic**
  - *leverages API specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, etc. as executable contracts allowing teams to get instantaneous feedback while making changes to avoid accidental breakage.*
  - *Generating free tests on the fly based only on your API specifications*
  - *Stubbing a service based on its API specification*
  - *API calls (JSon REST, SOAP XML, gRPC, Thrift, other binary protocols), Events via Messaging (Kafka, Redis, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Kinesis, etc.), DB, Other Data Stores, File system*
  - <https://github.com/znsio/specmatic>
- **microcks**
  - *platform for turning your API and microservices assets - OpenAPI specs, AsyncAPI specs, gRPC protobuf, GraphQL schema, Postman collections, SoapUI projects - into live mocks in seconds*
  - *also reuses these assets for running compliance and non-regression tests against your API implementation*
