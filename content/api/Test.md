  - *If you are familiar with Cucumber / Gherkin, the big difference here is that you don't need to write extra "glue" code or Java "step definitions" !*
  - DSL, Java
  - *combine API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing and even UI automation into a single, unified framework.*
  - *The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers.*
  - *Powerful JSON & XML assertions are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed. Test execution and report generation feels like any standard Java project.*
  - *A Java API exists for those who prefer to programmatically integrate Karate's rich automation and data-assertion capabilities.*
  - *But there's also a stand-alone executable for teams not comfortable with Java. You don't have to compile code. Just write tests in a simple, readable syntax - carefully designed for HTTP, JSON, GraphQL and XML. And you can mix API and UI test-automation within the same test script.*

  - Bestandteile
    - RESTler (restler-fuzzer)
      - *finding security and reliability bugs*
      - *For a given service with an OpenAPI/Swagger specification, RESTler analyzes its entire specification, and then generates and executes tests that exercise the service through its REST API.*

  - *Automation testing is cool, but what if you could automate testers? More specifically, what if you could automate all of the process of writing test cases, getting test data, writing the automation tests and then running them? This is what CATS does.*
  - *Generate tests at runtime based on OpenApi specs*
  - *enables you to generate hundreds of API tests within seconds with no coding effort.*
  - *All tests cases are generated and run automatically based on a pre-defined set of 72 Fuzzers. The Fuzzers cover different types of testing like: negative testing, boundary testing, structural validations, security and even end-to-end functional flows.*

- **RESTest**
  - *Automated Black-Box Testing of RESTful Web APIs*
  - *test cases are automatically derived from the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) of the API under test*
  - *RESTest generates REST Assured test cases* (Java)
  - *test failures are collected and they can be easily spotted and analyzed in a user-friendly GUI, built with Allure*
