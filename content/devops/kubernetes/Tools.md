# Tools
- docker-desktop â†’ Docker/Tools
- **Helm**
  - <https://helm.sh>
  - *The package manager for Kubernetes*
  - *Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.*
  - *Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application*
  - Helm Dashboard
    - <https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard> 
- **lens**
  - *The Kubernetes IDE*
  - <https://github.com/lensapp/lens>
- **kompose**
  - *go from Docker Compose to Kubernetes*
  - *takes a Docker Compose file and translates it into Kubernetes resources*
  - <https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose>
- **argo-cd**
  - *Declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes.*
  - <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd> *6.8k
- **pixie**
  - *Instant Kubernetes-Native Application Observability*
  - *Use Pixie to view the high-level state of your cluster (service maps, cluster resources, application traffic) and also drill-down into more detailed views (pod state, flame graphs, individual full-body application requests).*
  - <https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie>
- **kubesphere**
  - *is a distributed operating system for cloud-native application management, using Kubernetes as its kernel*
  - *It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI*
  - <https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere>
- **kubeapps**
  - *web-based UI for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes clusters*
  - <https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps>
- **kubespray**
  - *Deploy a Production Ready Kubernetes Cluster*
  - <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray>
- **telepresence**
  - *Local development against a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster*
  - <https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence>
- **mizu**
  - *API traffic viewer for Kubernetes enabling you to view all API communication between microservices. Think TCPDump and Wireshark re-invented for Kubernetes*
  - <https://github.com/up9inc/mizu>
- **kustomize**
  - *introduces a template-free way to customize application configuration that simplifies the use of off-the-shelf applications. Now, built into kubectl as `apply -k`.*
  - <https://kustomize.io/>
- **kubernetes-client/java**
  - <https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java>
- **opencost**
  - *visibility into current and historical Kubernetes spend and resource allocation* 
  - <https://github.com/opencost/opencost>
- **kubescape**
  - *providing a multi-cloud K8s single pane of glass, including risk analysis, security compliance, RBAC visualizer and image vulnerabilities scanning*
  - *scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, detecting misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks, software vulnerabilities, and RBAC (role-based-access-control) violations at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline, calculates risk score instantly and shows risk trends over time* 
  - <https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape>
- **Tanzu Community Edition**
  - free 
  - *no longer an actively maintained project. Code is available for historical purposes only.* 
  - <https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition>
  - [YT - VMware Tanzu Community Edition Installation and creating an unmanaged Kubernetes cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEMuiagEAg4)
- **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid**
  - <https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid>
- **Devtron**
  - *tool integration platform for Kubernetes*
  - *deeply integrates with products across the lifecycle of microservices,i.e., CI, CD, security, cost, debugging, and observability via an intuitive web interface.* 
  - <https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron>
- **cdk8s**
  - *development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs. cdk8s apps synthesize into standard Kubernetes manifests which can be applied to any Kubernetes cluster.*
  - Langs: TS, JS, Python, Java, Go
  - <https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s> 
  - <https://cdk8s.io/>
- **DevSpace**
  - *Client-Only Developer Tool for Cloud-Native Development with Kubernetes*
  - *Build, test and debug applications directly inside Kubernetes. Develop with hot reloading: updates your running containers without rebuilding images or restarting containers.* 
  - <https://github.com/loft-sh/devspace> 


## Java
- **Kubernetes & OpenShift Java Client**
  - <https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client>
- **JKube**
  - *collection of plugins and libraries that are used for building container images using Docker, JIB or S2I build strategies. Eclipse JKube generates and deploys Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests at compile time too.*
  - *also provides a set of tools such as watch, debug, log, etc. to improve your developer experience*
