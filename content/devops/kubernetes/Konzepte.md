# Konzepte

## Komponenten, Terminologie
- **Pod**
  - *smallest unit of k8s*
  - *abstraction over container*
  - *usually one container per pod*
  - *each pod gets own ip address*
  - *new ip address on re-creation*
  - *every pod gets a unique IP and hostname and within a pod, containers can talk to each other via localhost*
  - *containers in one pod can communicate via shared memory*
  - *Under the hood, they heavily rely on Linux namespaces and cgroups*
- **Service**
  - *permanent (static) ip address & DNS name that can be 'attached' to a pod*
  - *lifecycle of service and pod are not connected*
  - *load balancer; can be attached to multiple pods (on different nodes)*
- **Node**
  - *simple server, physical or virtual machine*
  - *worker node*
    - *multiple pods can run on one node (eg. application pod, database pod)*
    - *3 processes must be installed on every node*
      - *container runtime*
      - *kubelet*
        - *interacts with the container and the node*
        - *starts the pod with a container inside*
        - *assigns resources (CPU, RAM, storage) from node to the container*
      - *Kube proxy (k-proxy)*
        - *forwards requests from services to pods*
  - *master node*
    - *demand less resources than worker nodes*
    - *4 processes run on every master node*
      - *API Server*
        - *cluster gateway*
        - *validates authentication*
        - *forwards requests: deploy new apps, create new services, schedule pods*
      - *Scheduler*
        - *schedule new pods*
        - *decides on which node (based on resource exhaustion) to put the pod*
      - *Controller manager*
        - *detects and re-schedules (via request to Scheduler) crashed pods*
      - *etcd*
        - *key-value-store of cluster state (resources, health)*
        - *distributed among the cluster's master nodes*
        - *the cluster's "brain"*
        - *does not contain application data*
- **Ingress**
  - *entry point for external requests*
  - *forwards incoming requests to services*
- **ConfigMap**
  - *external configuration of application*
  - *connected to pod*
  - *usually contains URLs of database*
  - *accessed via environment variables or properties file*
- **Secret**
  - *like ConfigMap, for secret data (credentials, certificates)*
  - *stored in Base64*
- **Volumes**
  - *for persistent data*
  - *attaches physical storage to pod*
  - *storage is on local node or remote (outside of k8s cluster)*
- **Deployment**
  - *abstraction on top of pod*
  - *blueprint for creating pods*
  - *in practice, you don't create or work with pods directly*
  - *checks on the health of your Pod and restarts the Pod's Container if it terminates. Deployments are the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods.*
  - *DBs can't be replicated via Deployment (not stateless)*
  - *manages replicasets*
  - *everything below deployments is managed automatically by k8s*
- **StatefulSet**
  - *meant for stateful applications like databases*
  - *replicate stateful apps*
  - *DBs are often hosted outside of the k8s cluster*
  - [HN - Kubernetes StatefulSets are Broken, 13.8.22](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32439255)
- **Replicaset**
  - *manages the replicas of a pod*
  - *in practice, you don't create, update or delete replicasets, you work with deployments*
