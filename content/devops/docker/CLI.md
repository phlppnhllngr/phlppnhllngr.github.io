# CLI
- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/>
- **attach**
  - *attach your terminal’s standard input, output, and error (or any combination of the three) to a running container*
- **builder**
  - prune
    - Löscht den Build-Cache 
    - `docker builder prune --all --force`  
- **compose**
  - *The new Compose V2, which supports the compose command as part of the Docker CLI, is now available.*
  - *Run docker compose up and the Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run docker-compose up using Compose standalone (docker-compose binary).*
  - <https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/>
  - -> Docker/Tools/compose
- **events**
  - *get real-time events from the server* 
  - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/>
  - <https://dev.to/themreza/monitoring-and-logging-docker-events-59oi>
- **exec**
  - `docker exec -it <name/id> /bin/sh`
  - "Inline": `docker exec <name/id> /bin/sh -c "echo $HOME"`
- **history**
  - *Show the history of an image* 
  - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/history/>
- **image**
  - ls
- **inspect**
  - *provides detailed information on constructs controlled by Docker* 
  - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect/>
- **logs**
  - `docker logs <name/id>`
- **run**
  - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>
  - *Four of the Dockerfile commands cannot be overridden at runtime: FROM, MAINTAINER, RUN, and ADD. Everything else has a corresponding override in docker run.* 
  - `docker run --rm --name=<container-name> <image>`
  - `-v`
    - bind mount: relative Pfade nicht möglich (docker-compose: ja); Abhilfe: `%CD%` (Windows/cmd) bzw. `${pwd}` (powershell) oder `$PWD` (Linux)
    - → Docker/Storage
  - `--memory`
    - <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#limit-a-containers-access-to-memory> 
  - `--memory-swap`
    - *Operating systems use swap space to create the so called virtual memory (which is obviously bigger then the RAM you might have).* 
    - *If `--memory-swap` is set to the same value as `--memory`, and `--memory` is set to a positive integer, the container does not have access to swap*
    - *By specifying `--memory=20m` and `--memory-swap=30m` we allow 10 MB of swap.*
    - *The best you'll get out of an HDD right now is 150 MB/s. The maximum speed of transfer of an SSD is 600 MB/s, as that is the max speed of a SATA3 connection. They are usually slower than this though. The maximum speed of transfer of DDR3-800 RAM is 6400 MB/s (so the slowest DDR3 RAM around). These are all approximate and handwavy. However, while an SSD is quicker, HDD is 2% of RAM transfer rate, and SSD at its very best is 9% of RAM transfer rate.*
    - <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>
  - `--memory-reservation`
    - *is softlimit for the memory when docker detects there isn't enough memory*
    - *it will decrease the memory till the reservation limit is hit. (That's why it has to be smaller than the memory flag)*
    - *upper bound is `--memory` and lower bound is `--memory-reservation`.*
- **system**
  - prune
    - *Remove all unused [stopped] containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.*
    - `docker system prune --all --volumes --force`
    - Optionen
      - `--all`
        - *Remove all unused images not just dangling ones*
        - *An unused image means that it has not been assigned or used in a container. For example, when running docker ps -a - it will list all of your exited and currently running containers. Any images shown being used inside any of containers are a "used image".*
        - *a dangling image just means that you've created the new build of the image, but it wasn't given a new name. So the old images you have becomes the "dangling image". Those old image are the ones that are untagged and displays "<none>" on its name when you run docker images.*
      - `--force`
        - *Do not prompt for confirmation* 
      - `--volumes`
        - *Prune volumes* 
      - `--filter`  
    - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/>  
- **volume**
    - create
        - driver
            - local
        - <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/>
    - <https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/>
