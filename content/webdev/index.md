- **Http/2 (Http 2)**
  - *HTTP/2 leaves most of HTTP 1.1's high-level syntax, such as methods, status codes, header fields, and URIs, the same. What is new is how the data is framed and transported between the client and the server*
  - *HTTP/2 allows the server to "push" content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested. This allows the server to supply data it knows a web browser will need to render a web page, without waiting for the browser to examine the first response, and without the overhead of an additional request cycle*

## Cross-browser
- *iOS forces all browsers to use the same browser engine (WebKit, aka the engine used by Safari). So, on iOS, Chrome/Firefox/etc are just fancy wrappers around the Safari engine. Thatâ€™s why supported tech is the same in all browsers there.*
